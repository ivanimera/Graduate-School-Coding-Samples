Instructions
 
In your resource folder there is a file/library called linkedlist.py.  It is an object oriented implementation of a linked list with insert, getSize and printLL methods.

Another program, usell.py, uses the linkedlist library to create a linked list with four names.  The insert operation places the name at the front of the list and pushes the rest of the list down.  using the printLL method to print the linkedlist from beginning to end confirms this as the first item we inserted (“Lars”) is the last item in the list.

Go to the linked list library “linkedlist.py” and add a method called “getNum(n).”  getNum(n) should return the data item from the node in the nth spot in the list.  For example.

If I run getNum(2) I should see this:
